# single-spa-login-example-with-npm-packages

Single-spa application example which imports registered applications from NPM packages and manages authentication features as login.

## ‚úçüèª Motivation

This application is a little [demo](https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com/) of how you can use single-spa splitting code with [Option 2: NPM packages](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/separating-applications#option-2-npm-packages)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo

You can see a working demo of this application in the next link: [https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com](https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com/).

The login validation is harcoded in code and the credentials are:

| User          | Password      |     
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| admin         | 12345         |

## üíª Run in localhost

If you prefer run this application in localhost you must follow next steps:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

Finally you only have to open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a browser to see the app running

This application is developed with **Angular JS** and is mounted when home icon in navbar is clicked. In that case the url will be **/** and all **Angular JS** routes will be managed by **angular-ui-router**. By the moment this application has only one default routed view.

This application is developed with **Angular v8** and is mounted when **Angular** navbar item is clicked. In that case the url will be **/angular** and all **Angular** routes will be managed by **angular router**.
