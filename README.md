# single-spa-login-example-with-npm-packages

Single-spa application example which imports registered applications from NPM packages and manages authentication features as login.

## ‚úçüèª Motivation

This application is a little [demo](https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com/) of how you can use single-spa splitting code with [Option 2: NPM packages](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/separating-applications#option-2-npm-packages)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo

You can see a working demo of this application in the next link: [https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com](https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com/).

The login validation is harcoded in code and the credentials are:

| User          | Password      |     
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| admin         | 12345         |

## üíª Run in localhost

If you prefer run this application in localhost you must follow next steps:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

Finally you only have to open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a browser to see the app running


## single-spa applications

This application is a root-application that inits a single-spa application that integrates several registered applications:

- [single-spa-auth-app](https://github.com/jualoppaz/single-spa-auth-app)
- [single-spa-layout-app](https://github.com/jualoppaz/single-spa-layout-app)
- [single-spa-angular-app](https://github.com/jualoppaz/single-spa-angular-app)

### üîê single-spa-auth-app

This application is displayed by default as there is no logged in user. A login form is printed and the credentials can be set for perform the login and access to the private views.

### üß± single-spa-layout-app
